Notes on configuring apache / mod_python :

You will need to configure Apache to load the mod_python module, 
and then tell it to use mod_python for the pvarch directory.
That will generally look something like this:


  LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so

  <Directory /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/pvarch >
    AllowOverride FileInfo
    AddHandler mod_python .py
    PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
    PythonDebug  Off
  </Directory>

depending on the exact layout of Apache. 

The file httpd_pvarch.conf that is generated by 
   python setup.py install

should be accurate description of your system.

Once added to Apache's httpd.conf (or to another config
file loaded by Apache),  restart Apache 
    ...../bin/apachectl restart

and you should be off and running.
