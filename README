This is the Epics PV Archiver, a system for archiving Epics PV data to a MySQL
database and viewing these data using a web interface.  Yes, there are other
Epics archiver tools available.  This one is pure python and relatively easy
for a non-Epics expert to set up and use.

The system has grown over the years, but designed for the
Linux/Apache/MySQL/Python set of tools and requires the following components:

  - apache webserver:  Apache 2.2, at least.

  - mysql: MySQL or MariaDB, usually a linux installation will include a
           package for this, though you may need "devel" packages, and
	   you may need to set up mysql to actually be running on your server.

  - Python3: version 3.5 or higher.

  - mod_wsgi for Python3.  Many linux distributions include this as an
    available package.

  - Pyepics: 3.4.0 or higher (you do not need "epics base").
